This assignment consist of a python code for 3 coloring problem.

Algorithm:

1. Input is a graph G 
2. Make a copy H of graph G
3. Initialize the color of each node to be "colorless".
4. Dissolve the coloring of the Graph G in graph H by giving three attributes to each node red_tag, blue_tag and green_tag
5. for each node in the graph 
	a) make a list of the neighbours colors  
	b) By checking the list of neighbours see which color could be assign to this node
		i) If only one color is available then assign it to this.
		ii) If two colors is available then randomly assign one of them to it.
		iii) If no colors is available, then no assignment is possible.
6. Repeat step 1 to step 5 for 3^n-1 times.

This code also plots a graph of numer of nodes vs time taken for various inputs.
