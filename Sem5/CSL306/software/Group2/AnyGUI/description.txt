Instructions to run the demo application:

1. Place all five files (tk_GUI.py, qt_GUI.py, gtk_GUI.py, wx_GUI.py, demo.py) in one folder.  

2. Run the python file demo.py to see our demo application.

3. Import the name of the GUI file you want to use for the demo

	eg. from wx_GUI import *
	
4. It will display a sample application

Note: There is also a demo_tk.py file with slight modification for tk_GUI due to a small compatibility issue that there is no event keyword support in tkInter.
